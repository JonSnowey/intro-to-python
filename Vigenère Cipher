#Vigenère Cipher

#The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher which was a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. What this means is that opposed to having a single shift that is applied to every letter, the Vigenère Cipher has a different shift for each individual letter. The value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword.

spy_message_1 = "txm srom vkda gl lzlgzr qpdb? fepb ejac! ubr imn tapludwy mhfbz cza ruxzal wg zztylktoikqq!"

keyword = "friends"

#repeat the keyword over and over to generate a keyword phrase that is the same lenght as the message we want to code. then we shift each letter of our message by the place value of the corresponding letter in the keyword phrase

#              message:    b  a  r  r  y    i  s    t  h  e    s  p  y
#       keyword phrase:    d  o  g  d  o    g  d    o  g  d    o  g  d
#resulting place value:    24 12 11 14 10   2  15   5  1  1    4  9  21
#encoded result :     ymlok cp fbb ejv
